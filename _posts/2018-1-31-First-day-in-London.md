## Flying Across the Atlantic
Wow did we underestimate everything about that flight.  Easy drive, easy to get to the Airport via Bart from Downtown Oakland (only a couple stops and you're there!) but horrible terrible flight.  Ten hours is too long to spend sitting and there isn't enough water in the world to keep a person hydrated.  They pack you in like sardines so it's impossible to get comfortable.

On top of that they do meal service 15 minutes into the flight.  So I woke up from my half-sleep state, we're up to 5 hours and 15 minutes of total sleep for this day by the way, and get my food even though we're barely outside of California airspace.  Now I spend the rest of the time sweating and bumping shoulders with Liz and some random who doesn't know what to do with his elbows.

All-in-all it went by pretty quick.  Despicable Me 3 really loses its subtletly around the 3rd showing but I can't complain about having nothing to do.

## Interesting Things About Europe 
* The trashcan has not been invented yet over here.  Walked around with trash in my pocket for 35 minutes.
* Everyone thinks my lack of knowledge about their currency is hilarious.  No I don't know which one is a ten pence, I don't know what the hell a pence is.
* Everyone's dream is to immigrate to California.
* Trains are dope.
