## Flying Across the Atlantic

Wow did we underestimate everything about that flight.  Easy drive, easy to get to the Airport via Bart from Downtown Oakland (only a couple stops and you're there!) but horrible terrible flight.  Ten hours is too long to spend sitting and they pack you in like sardines so its impossible to get comfortable sleep.

On top of that they do meal service 15 minutes into the flight.  So I woke up from my half-sleep state, we're up to 5 hours and 15 minutes of total sleep for this day by the way, and get my food even though we're barely outside of California airspace.

Now I spend the rest of the time sweating and bumping shoulders with Liz and some random who doesn't know what to do with his elbows.
