## It Is Really Cold Here
I promised Liz I wouldn't complain about California cold ever again.  Unless I see snow I'm never going to encounter this kind of weather in California.  Oh my god is it so cold.

On our second day in Rotterdam I bought another coat.  This one keeps the wind out and mysteriously stopped my headaches.  I can't prove it, nor do I want to, but I think it was so cold I was getting headaches.  As a side note Liz also said I was less grouchy and annoying.

## The People
Despite the weather these are the friendliest Europeans we've encountered!  They'll help you find the right way to where you're going, they'll make sure to alert you on any need-to-know info when you're shopping around for bus routes or anything touristy.  All in all this has been the most fun we've had with the locals.

## The History
Our second Dutch city stay was in a fairly "new" house built in the 1900s.  Our Airbnb host laughed and said that must "sound old to you", this was true, it did sound old.  But we realized we passed through a town that started in 1200 AD... so its all about perspective I guess.

Rotterdam was amazing from a human standpoint.  The place was levelled during World War II, the pictures show the devestation very well.  78% of the locals were made homeless after just a year I think.  So they rebuilt the city using modern techniques and design.

And it paid off!  The city looks amazing, it is a productive place with lots of people flocking to it every year.  Lots of what they've done could be done in American towns and cities since we have the land and the need to revitalize.
