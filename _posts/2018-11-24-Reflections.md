## Two Things
1. I don't like change
2. I'm an idiot

All of the things I wrote were usually written within 24-48 hours and captured my mood and general displeasure of a new experience.  This isn't an excuse, just a reality of my situation.  There is an overarching negative thread throughout each post but let me reassure you, I HAD FUN!!

## I Loved It and I Hated It
I was cold and uncomfortable but the longer I went the more I got used to the discomfort.  Travelling perpetually would _not_ be a problem for me.  In fact it would be wonderful.

But given who I am I'm going to focus on the jarring and uncomfortable aspects as highlights.  The background tapestry was one of **amazement**, **curiosity**, and **joy**.  I cannot ignore the painful parts just like I can't ignore the color red in a bright picture.  The sum of the parts makes something greater than each moment.

## End of the Year
Moving to Oakland at the end of the trip, literally two weeks after landing back in the USA, made the year fly by.  This trip started at the beginning of the year and was like a rocket blastoff launching us into a whole new world.

## Going Back
In this new world I know we'll be going back to Europe at some point and our top place to visit is the Netherlands.  We both would love to bike around in the Spring or Summer. Camp, stay in hostels, and just see the whole country from a bike road.

Opportunites like that aren't really available in the US.  The bike roads here are few and far between. All priorities are given to vehicles and trucks at all costs, whether that be conevenience or human life.

So these trips are going to continue happening and I doubt I'll have a sparkling inconvenience free time but I know I'll have fun!
