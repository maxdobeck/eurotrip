# More Coffee
A total of 23,000 steps on the first real day in London.  Not only is that well above my average step count of 0 but I'm still tired.  We've kept to our rule of "sun's up, we're up" but god is it hard.  I'm starting to think London has a reputation for being expensive becuase people are constantly stopping in for coffee whenever they can.

Even with the exhaustion it has been fun finding our way through the winding tube sytem.  We were definitely not prepared for the pace of the daily commuters but caught up quickly.  We can now walk briskly and mostly stay out of people's way.  This has so far been the most mentally involved public transit system due to the sheer number of options.  I can't believe getting around a city this big is this easy and I'd love to have a system like this at home.

Some of our major stops that I can remember from a thick black fog of exhaustion:
## British Museum
Lots of old stuff in here!  Unlike a lot of other museums there was a more personal take on each period in history. For instance the lives of egyptians peasants were uncovered to a degree.  It turns out that the only path to wealth in Egypt was State work.

If you controlled the tax money you got to be buried in a giant tomb.  If you grew the food you got to die young and sick.  Nobody wrote about the common folk back then and most of their history is essentially lost to time because it wasn't recorded.

The common theme throughout human history seems to be the masses fighting for what we would consider basic humane rights.  In a way it must feel  like we've won from our ancestor's perspectives.

## Transit Museum
## Tralfagar Square
## A nice ~~nap~~ Movie about Winston Churchill
## A park near the House of Commons
## Old Buildings
## Trying to find a grocery store, water fountain, or trashcan
## Ambushing the people opening a breakfast place
