# More Coffee
A total of 23,000 steps on the first real day in London.  Not only is that well above my average step count of 0 but I'm still tired.  We've kept to our rule of "sun's up, we're up" but god is it hard.  I'm starting to think London has a reputation for being expensive becuase people are constantly stopping in for coffee whenever they can.

Even with the exhaustion it has been fun finding our way through the winding tube sytem.  We were definitely not prepared for the pace of the daily commuters but caught up quickly.  We can now walk briskly and mostly stay out of people's way.  This has so far been the most mentally involved public transit system due to the sheer number of options.  I can't believe getting around a city this big is this easy and I'd love to have a system like this at home.

Some of our major stops that I can remember from a thick black fog of exhaustion:
## British Museum
Lots of old stuff in here!  Unlike a lot of other museums there was a more personal take on each period in history. For instance the lives of egyptians peasants were uncovered to a degree.  It turns out that the only path to wealth in Egypt was State work.

If you controlled the tax money you got to be buried in a giant tomb.  If you grew the food you got to die young and sick.  Nobody wrote about the common folk back then and most of their history is essentially lost to time because it wasn't recorded.

The common theme throughout human history seems to be the masses fighting for what we would consider basic humane rights.  In a way it must feel  like we've won from our ancestor's perspectives.

## Transit Museum
This was fun because it gave an overview of transportation technology and culture.  In addition it gave a context around the expansion  of London in geographical terms and population density.  The transformation of London from a small sleepy town to a massive city happened because of the cutting edge rail system.

The people of London know how critical mass transit is and even honor the people involved in the various projects.  The designers of trains, the workers who dug the tunnels, even the individual who invented the tool to help dig tunnels have an monument in their name.  

This museum made it easy to correlate economic growth with transit and I hope I get to see a transformation like this in my own country.  If our cities, counties, and states were connected this well people would flourish.  Tourism alone would be a massive boon to any area near a nature reserve or protected land.

## Tralfagar Square
It was very busy, there were some cool thumbs, but the meaning of this area was lost on me.  There was a famous Admiral who won four important battles so he got the tall monument.

## A nice ~~nap~~ Movie about Winston Churchill
We finally saw the Churchill movie with Gary Oldman.  It was great to see but Liz slept through the first few minutes.  I can't blame her because we walked 100% times the miles we normally do on any given day.  And technically it was like 3am on the Pacific Coast.  Great time to see the movie though, really gave perspective on Britain during WWII and the importance of an international community.

## A park near the House of Commons
It was a nice park and fun to see the government officials running around.  There's a strange practice of running to work though.  I still need to stop one of these people and find out more about this but essentially they jog their way through the crowds in running gear with their work clothes strapped to their back.

I'm assuming their workplaces have showers or wetnaps but I'm just impressed they were out and moving in 38 degree weather.
## Old Buildings
Pretty much every building is old.  I can't imaagin maintaining or working with buildings this old. There must be entire companies built around bringing old structures up to code.

## Trying to find a grocery store, water fountain, or trashcan
So far none of these things exist in British culture.  Time will tell if this is a European thing or a London thing but oh my god.  The responsibility of carrying an empty coffee cup for 20-40 minutes has become a familiar one.  Judging by the lack of trashcans I can see why some people just throw their trash on the ground.

Trashcans aren't the only shy structures around, we also have missing water fountains!  The bulk of our travels are made lighter by not having to carry around any extra water weight.  The water issue is serious because we're used to a certain standard in America.  If you're at a national park? Water is freely available.  If you're at a museum?  Water around every corner.  If you're near a bathroom?  Grab a sip of water.

Grocery stores were a problem because certain businesses have specialized into offering items you'd normally find under one roof.  The local "chemist" or pharmacy contains things like cosmetics, medicine, bathroom supplies, qtips, etc.  But you can't get this at the same shop that gives you food, cooking supplies, shampoo etc.  It was frustrating at first but we only need those specialty items once so all-in-all it isn't a major inconvenience just a learning curve.
