## Leaving Chico
The first day of travel didn't start great because it started around 1am for us.  We both stayed up way too late checking our bags, passport, etc, etc, and cleaning the house.  This meant last minute


## Flying out of Oakland
We're sitting in the waiting area waiting to board and Liz thought it would be a good idea to get some extra water for the plane.  The cashier asked her, "Before I ring this up are you OK with this being $5?"  It was a bottle of chilled Smart Water but it must be a daily occurence of customers being shocked at the price and putting the water back.  The cashiers must have a constant cycle of restocking overpriced water bottles that people refuse to buy.

Either way this is a good purchase because Liz and I both get so dehydrated that we end up tracking down the flight attendants for any sort of hydration.  We will also resort to "taking just a sip" and chugging half the water bottle.   This being our longest flight we may have underestimated how much water/snacks to bring but we'll see in a few hours.
