title: 5 Days of London and 3 Days of Homesickness
---

## Homesick
The first few days were fun and filled with secret looks between Liz and me as very British things happened around us.  At first we couldn't believe British accents were real, as dumb as that sounds, it was fun to hear people talk about daily things.  But after a few days of interacting with the British it got old.  They're fairly unfriendly, short, and would straight out ignore our questions.

Realizing that good service  or friendliness weren't innate human qualities but were cultural byproducts stung a little at first.  We didn't realize that basic pleasantries or occasionally going above the call of duty were things to take for granted.  Essentially what we missed were basic human connections that bind together typical American interactions.  We had no idea how different our two cultures would be.

## London Work Hours
People typically start their day around 8 or 9 in the morning.  This means they leave their house around 8 and start work around 8:30 or 9.  Based on our encounters with rush hour they don't adjust their schedule based on the start time, they are out of the office around 4 or 5 in the afternoon.  We couldn't tell if the British worked less than a 40 hour work week or there was slightly staggered start/stop times for the workday.

It wasn't just the people starting later, we saw kids getting dropped off at school around 8:30 in the morning, sometimes as late as 9.  The parents were obviously headed back to work after they dropped their kid off so it seemed like workplaces are very accomodating of family/life obligations outside of work.  This may not be a universal truth but our plans to avoid the 7-8am commuter rush really backfired!

## London Work Culture
Liz and I agreed we wouldn't want to work pretty much anywhere we came into contact with.  Working at most of the food service places looked miserable, working at the train station looked miserable, even at the museums people were pretty dour looking.  

For the most part it seemed to be the co-workers and environment making the working experience miserable.  Lots of unhappy people thrown together in a cloudy damp environment acted as a catalyst to create a DMV type experience.

## English Food (I Swear To God If I See Butter On A Sandwich I Will Throw It Away)
Liz and I threw out our sandwhiches from a museum cafeteria.  They were virtually untouched as two bites in we realized that butter had been spread on each sandwhich, top and bottom.  These were pulled pork sandwhiches with BBQ sauce and large amounts of butter.

Liz ate the pulled pork out of her sandwhich and I picked out the veggies and cheese in mine.  Everything we could not salvage went straight in the trash.  We both ate at the museum out of desperation so this was a huge blow to our blood sugar.  So we bought a scone!  Problem solved, right?

To make a long story short the scone ended up in the trash.  I ate the first couple bites but whoa that was one bitter scone.  It somehow tasted like old cheese which really capped off the whole butter sandwhich experience.  But this was the last straw with us: nasty scones, butter on regular sandwhiches, bland soup, none of our culinary experiences were good unless it involved a former colony.

Most of the Indian food or any food with "curry" in the title was excellent.  It started to feel mildly offensive though because the "curry" title seems to apply to anything that doesn't originate from the British isles.  It would be like us calling all Thai food, Chinese food, and Mexican food "curry".  But maybe there's a food history I'm not aware of.

## London's Public Spaces Are Not Public
There is one sign that you'll see in London constantly but you can't find it anywhere in America.  "CCTV Cameras are in use."  This isn't for traffic or to watch an  ATM or an elevator, its EVERYWHERE.  They have flooded this city with security cameras!  Public spaces, private businesses, banks, parking garages, you name it they have a camera.  Even houses have cameras above their doors.  

I'm not sure who has access to these cameras but oh boy I don't care.  The psychological impact was weird, you just knew in the back of your mind, "Someone's watching".  It was partly reassuring knowing that it could deter muggings, especially when Liz and I got more pounds out at dark ATM.  But there was also something tedious about it.  Constant watching, constantly seeing that black lens staring back at you.

Then there's the problem of the literal public spaces.  Parks, museums, historical sites, etc.  These were all "donated by the queen" or "gifted by the royal family".  They were basically royal centers loaned out to the British Government who then maintained it for the public to enjoy.  

In America if a public space is public it is purely by, for, and because of the public.  We may face challenges in this area depending on who won the last election cycle but no one gave us public parks or nature reserves to keep the peasants happy.  

We said as a collective, "This should be for everyone to come out and see".  There was a basic sense of self-determination and planning.  The end result doesn't really change but I strongly prefer our method of land management and appropriation.  It may have its own downside but I'd take it over anything I saw in England.
