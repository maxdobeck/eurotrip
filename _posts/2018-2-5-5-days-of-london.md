title: 5 Days of London and 3 Days of Homesickness
---

## Homesick
The first few days were fun and filled with secret looks between Liz and me as very British things happened around us.  At first we couldn't believe British accents were real, as dumb as that sounds, it was fun to hear people talk about daily things.  But after a few days of interacting with the British it got old.  They're fairly unfriendly, short, and would straight out ignore our questions.

Realizing that good service  or friendliness weren't innate human qualities but were cultural byproducts stung a little at first.  We didn't realize that basic pleasantries or occasionally going above the call of duty were things to take for granted.  Essentially what we missed were basic human connections that bind together typical American interactions.  We had no idea how different our two cultures would be.

## London Work Hours
People typically start their day around 8 or 9 in the morning.  This means they leave their house around 8 and start work around 8:30 or 9.  Based on our encounters with rush hour they don't adjust their schedule based on the start time, they are out of the office around 4 or 5 in the afternoon.  We couldn't tell if the British worked less than a 40 hour work week or there was slightly staggered start/stop times for the workday.

It wasn't just the people starting later, we saw kids getting dropped off at school around 8:30 in the morning, sometimes as late as 9.  The parents were obviously headed back to work after they dropped their kid off so it seemed like workplaces are very accomodating of family/life obligations outside of work.  This may not be a universal truth but our plans to avoid the 7-8am commuter rush really backfired!

## London Work Culture
Liz and I agreed we wouldn't want to work pretty much anywhere we came into contact with.  Working at most of the food service places looked miserable, working at the train station looked miserable, even at the museums people were pretty dour looking.  

For the most part it seemed to be the co-workers and environment making the working experience miserable.  Lots of unhappy people thrown together in a cloudy damp environment acted as a catalyst to create a DMV type experience.
